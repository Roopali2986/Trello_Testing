# Trello_Testing
Create a simple test suite that combines verification of basic functionality of [Trello](https://trello.com/) task management tool both through its UI and REST API.

### Please find 2 folders :
API Testing : This contains the Java REST Assured API project.
UI Testing  : This contains Cypress javascript code.

## API Testing – Folder
Please goto the below path to find the code : C:\Users\admin\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Trello_Testing\APITesting\RestAssuredProject\target\test-classes\trellotest
Name : testRestAPI_scenarios
Run the code in eclipse using TestNG. Prior to it, install the TestNG from eclipse marketplace. Also add all the necessary dependencies in POM.xml.
Also you can find the POM.xml under the below path to refer all the dependencies. 
RestAssuredProject\pom.xml

## UI Testing – Folder
Please open the code file in Visual Studio Code.
Download Node from nodejs.org website. Set NODE_HOME Environment variable. Create Cypress working folder and generate package.json. Install the latest version of Cypress tool. Test runner component is available in Cypress.
In the terminal, run the test script: 
Cypress Automation > node_modules\.bin\cypress run
This will open the test runner and we can click on one particular spec file (trello.spec.js) to see how it runs. We can see the automation with screenshots recording.
